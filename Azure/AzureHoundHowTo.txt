Things you need before you start: 

Install Bloodhound  

Install AzureHound 

If on Windows you need the AMD Version 

Ensure it is the most current stable release and not a rolling release  

Ensure there is a Defender exception for the folders that you placed Azure/Bloodhound otherwise Defender will remove and block their execution 

Add a file exception for the actual file  

Add a process exception for azurehound.exe 

Create and Application in EntraID 

EntraID --> Applications --> New Registration --> <complete this> 

Ensure you assign your pim account to this application 

Create a Client Secret and ensure you save the secret value somewhere for later use 

EntraID --> App Registrations --> Go to the App you created --> Certificates & Secrets --> Client Secrets --> New Client Secret 

Now we need to allow Device Login 

EntraID --> Applications --> App Registration --> Authentication --> Advanced Settings --> Allow Public Client Flows --> YES 

Granting the Appropriate Permissions 

EntraID --> App Registrations --> Go to the app you created --> API Permissions --> Add a permission 

Required permissions 

Device. Read
Directory.Read.All
offline_access
openid
profile
User.Read

 

Give the Application necessary Permissions 

Will most likely need Global Admin to set this up 

Reference : AzureHound Enterprise Azure Configuration – BloodHound (bloodhoundenterprise.io) 

Give the Application "Directory Reader" role in Azure AD tenant 

Grant "Reader" role on all subscriptions
